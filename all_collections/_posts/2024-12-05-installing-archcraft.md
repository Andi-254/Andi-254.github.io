# Key Differences Between Archcraft and Other Arch Linux Distributions

## Pre-configured Window Manager

Archcraft comes with a pre-configured window manager (Openbox or bspwm) and desktop environment, whereas standard Arch Linux requires manual configuration of these components [0].

## Built-in Themes

Archcraft includes a set of pre-installed themes and a polished look out of the box, providing a more visually appealing experience compared to vanilla Arch Linux [0].

## Focus on Customization

While Archcraft provides a good starting point, it still allows for extensive customization through terminal commands and configuration files, catering to users who enjoy fine-tuning their system [0].

## Single Developer Maintenance

Unlike many Arch-based distributions that have large communities, Archcraft is primarily maintained by a single developer, which can affect its development pace and feature set [0].

## Rolling Release Model

Both Archcraft and standard Arch Linux follow a rolling release model, receiving continuous updates and improvements [2].

## Package Management

Archcraft uses the same package management system (pacman) as Arch Linux, allowing seamless integration with the Arch User Repository (AUR) [2].

## Minimal Base System

Similar to Arch Linux, Archcraft provides a minimal base system installation, allowing users to build upon it according to their needs [2].

## Learning Opportunity

While Archcraft offers a more polished experience, it still serves as a learning opportunity for users to understand the underlying system and gain experience with Arch Linux principles [0].

## Performance and Stability

Archcraft aims to address some common issues found in other distributions, such as performance problems with file selection screens and screen recording quality [0].

## Summary

Archcraft combines the flexibility and power of Arch Linux with a more user-friendly, pre-configured experience, making it an attractive option for users who want to leverage Arch's strengths with less initial setup time. Its unique blend of pre-configured elements and customization options sets it apart from other Arch-based distributions.
